        Use this space to create your to-do list. You can also check off items as you complete them. Remember to add tasks, not goals. Think about accomplishable projects, and be realistic about how much you can finish today. Here’s a suggestion – Add “Create a to-do list” to your list. That way, you can check it off right away and already have something done!

        <!---I plan to add a functional checklist to this page. So far I have no idea how to do it, but
        I'd like the boxes to fill with the below image when the user checks off an item.-->

        <img src="./images/checklist_blueberry.png" alt="a blueberry" />
        <img src="./images/checklistimage.png" alt="text reading You can do it! with images of a tomato and blueberries." />
