            Welcome to Pretty Pomodoro!

            This site is designed to provide you a one-stop shop for balancing productivity and wellbeing.
            In the other pages of this site, you will find a place to create a <a class="in-link" href="./checklist.html">checklist</a>
            and cross off items as you complete them; a <a class="in-link" href="./gallery.html">gallery</a> for relaxation during your breaks; 
            and a <a class="in-link" href="./resources.html">guide</a> to productivity and mental health resources. This front page is dedicated to a timer, which you can 
            use to implement the Pomodoro Method in your studies or work.
        </h1>

        <p>
            Here's how the Pomodoro works: <br>

            Set a timer for 25 minutes. During this time, work on the task at hand, and ONLY the task at hand. 
            When the timer goes off, set another timer for 5 minutes. Take this as a short break.
            After your break, restart the 25-minute timer and refocus.
            Every 4 “Pomodoros,” or rounds, take a longer break.

        </p>

        Invented by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, the Pomodoro Technique is designed to help those of us who 
        struggle with time management and anxiety surrounding our ever-present to-do lists to focus, get into flow state, 
        attend to our projects and obligations, and “change the relationship with time and reach our goals with less effort 
        and anxiety” (“The Pomodoro Technique,” cited below). Pomodoro means “tomato” in Italian, and the method is so 
        named because Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer when he invented the technique.
