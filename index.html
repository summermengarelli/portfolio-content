        Welcome to Pretty Pomodoro!

        This site is designed to provide you a one-stop shop for balancing productivity and wellbeing. In the other pages of this site, you will find a place to create a checklist [hyperlinked to page] and cross off items as you complete them; a collection of poems and exercises [hyperlinked to page] to find peace, inspiration, and entertainment during your breaks; and a guide [hyperlinked to page] to productivity and mental health resources. This front page is dedicated to a timer, which you can use to implement the Pomodoro Method in your studies or work. 

        Invented by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, the Pomodoro Technique is designed to help those of us who struggle with time management – and anxiety surrounding our ever-present to-do lists – to focus, get into flow state, attend to our projects and obligations, and “change the relationship with time and reach our goals with less effort and anxiety” (“The Pomodoro Technique,” cited below). Pomodoro means “tomato” in Italian, and the method is so named because Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer when he invented the technique. Here is how the Pomodoro works:

        Set a timer for 25 minutes. During this time, work on the task at hand, and ONLY the task at hand. 
        When the timer goes off, set another timer for 5 minutes. Take this as a short break.
        After your break, restart the 25-minute timer and refocus. 
        Every 4 “Pomodoros,” or rounds, take a longer break.
