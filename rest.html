        A key piece of the Pomodoro method is to take a break every 25 minutes -- and you really should take those breaks!
        Here, find some ways to unwind. First, follow along with Pretty Pom to
        practice diaphramatic breathing:

        <img src="./images/deepbreathing1.png" /> <!---The caption will say "First, find a comfortable lying position."-->
        <img src="./images/deepbreathing2.png" /> <!---Caption: "Place your hands on your stomach."-->
        <img src="./images/deepbreathing3.png" /> <!--Caption: "Inhale through your nose and allow your stomach to inflate."-->
        <img src="./images/deepbreathing4.png" /> <!---Caption: "Exhale through your mouth and empty the air from your stomach."-->

        Very good! Now, peruse a selection of inspirational poetry:

        <img src="./images/poem1.png" /> <!--All poems are in the public domain. I was thinking I can make the alt tag a transcription of the poems,
        but I'd actually rather embed a poem of the day website/widget on the page. I just picked 4 poems because this page requires 8 images.-->
